       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>At 31 years young, I call the sunny Tampa Bay Area in Florida home, residing just a mile from the breathtaking Gulf beaches. Recently, I embarked on a beautiful journey of marriage with my best friend and soulmate, Justin, now Forever PITTS! Our story began on my 30th birthday, where our connection was instantaneous, leading to a stunning wedding surrounded by the love of friends and family. I feel incredibly blessed. Having traveled to various destinations on spontaneous solo adventures, I've relished every moment. However, my heart finds joy in exploring alongside a companion. A lover of engaging conversations, I cherish connecting with people in every place I visit. My passions include music, photography, crafts, and my Standard Poodle, Miss Khloe Rae, along with another fur baby, Miss Noley Lynn. Together, we bask in the sunshine on beach outings. Hailing from New Jersey, I carry the raw and gritty Jersey girl attitude with pride. Hosting friends at my house brings me immense joy, and I thrive on the excitement of a good adventure. Family holds an irreplaceable place in my heart. While my previous career in Corrections offered valuable life lessons, I am currently pursuing Web Development, aiming to work remotely and embark on even more enriching vacations post-graduation in the summer of 2024!</p>

       <h3> Backstory to the Livsnjutare and Gypsy Soul</h3>

          <p> I've always felt like I possess an old soul, and perhaps it's a result of the people around me and the values they instilled in me. During my college days, someone labeled me a gypsy due to my penchant for exploring different places and getting into various experiences. Intrigued, I looked up the term and found that while the traditional definition didn't quite align with me, the second one resonated deeply: a nomadic or free-spirited person. Embracing this newfound identity, I playfully adopted the moniker "Gypsy Soul" for a social media platform, and now, it feels like my face should be beside its definition.</p>

           <p> A Gypsy Soul, to me, is someone who dreams of traversing the globe, craving new experiences and defying the constraints of rules and regulations. This term encapsulates my essence in two fundamental ways: first, a Gypsy Soul is brimming with energy, yearning to live life on their own terms; second, they find contentment in their own world, navigating life with wisdom and purpose.</p>
            
            <p>This resonates deeply with who I am, a self-proclaimed Gypsy Soul, a sentiment that many of my friends and family would likely affirm. In my quest to encapsulate my wanderlust, terms like wonderlust, nomad, and travel freak emerged in popular culture, but I sought a word uniquely mine. Enter "Livsnjutare" (Livs-n-ju-tare), discovered in the Swedish dictionary, translating to "Enjoyer of Life." For me, this phrase best captures the essence of my adventurous spirit, offering a personalized and evocative description of my love for life's journeys. </p>
